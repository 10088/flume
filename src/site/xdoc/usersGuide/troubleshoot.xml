        <h4>Handling agent failures</h4>
        <p>If the Flume agent goes down then the all the flows hosted on that agent are
          aborted. Once the agent is restarted, then flow will resume. The flow using
          jdbc or other stable channel will resume processing events where it left
          off. If the agent can't be restarted on the same, then there an option to
          migrate the database to another hardware and setup a new Flume agent that
          can resume processing the events saved in the db. The database HA futures
          can be leveraged to move the Flume agent to another host.
