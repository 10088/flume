      <p>
        A durable Channel implementation that uses the local file system for its storage.
      </p>
      <p>
        FileChannel works by writing all transactions to a set of directories
        specified in the configuration. Additionally, when a commit occurs
        the transaction is synced to disk. Pointers to events put on the
        channel are stored in memory. As such, each event on the queue
        will require 8 bytes of DirectMemory (non-heap). However, the channel
        will only allow a configurable number messages into the channel.
        The appropriate amount of direct memory for said capacity,
        must be allocated to the JVM via the JVM property: -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize
