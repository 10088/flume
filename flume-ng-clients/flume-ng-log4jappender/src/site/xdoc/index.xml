    <section name="Flume Log4j Appender">

      <p>
        Appends Log4j Events to an external Flume client which is decribed by
        the Log4j configuration file. The appender takes two required parameters:
        <br />
        <strong>Hostname</strong> : This is the hostname of the first hop
        at which Flume (through an AvroSource) is listening for events.
        <br />
        <strong>Port</strong> : This the port on the above host where the Flume
        Source is listening for events.
      </p>
      <p>
        A sample log4j properties file which appends to a source would look like:
      </p>
      <pre>
        log4j.appender.out2 = org.apache.flume.clients.log4jappender.Log4jAppender
        log4j.appender.out2.Port = 25430
        log4j.appender.out2.Hostname = foobarflumesource.com
        log4j.logger.org.apache.flume.clients.log4jappender = DEBUG,out2</pre>
       <p><i>Note: Change the last line to the package of the class(es), that will
        do the appending.For example if classes from the package
        com.bar.foo are appending, the last line would be:</i><br />
        <pre><p>log4j.logger.com.bar.foo = DEBUG,out2</p></pre>
       </p>
